# Bundle Up

## Introduction
Bundle Up (VærKlar) is a user-friendly weather app designed to assist parents with dressing their children during the morning rush. The app provides the current weather forecast and recommended clothing for the day. It's developed as a mobile-based web application with a Java Spring Boot backend and a React/TypeScript frontend, each packaged in separate Docker containers. The backend communicates with a cloud-based PostgreSQL database through Spring JPA and the front end through endpoints in the controller layer. Weather and location data are retrieved from external REST APIs.
